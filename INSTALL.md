# Download

***OpenCompGraphMaya*** can be downloaded from the
[Releases](https://github.com/david-cattermole/OpenCompGraphMaya/releases)
page on the GitHub [project page](https://github.com/david-cattermole/OpenCompGraphMaya).

For a simple installation, **do not** install from the
`Source code (zip)` or `Source code (tar.gz)` archives. These archives
are for developers only.

# Install Maya Module

***OpenCompGraphMaya*** can be installed by un-zipping the archive
(`.zip` or `.tar.gz`) file, and copying the contents into the
following directory on your computer:

On Windows:
```
C:\Users\<Your User Name>\My Documents\maya\<Maya Version>\modules
```

You may need to create the *modules* directory manually, as it is not
created default by Maya.

You should now have one file and one directory like this:
```
<maya user directory>\2018\modules\OpenCompGraphMaya-0.1.0-maya2018-win64.mod (module file)
<maya user directory>\2018\modules\OpenCompGraphMaya-0.1.0-maya2018-win64 (directory)
```

You can open Maya as normal. You must load the plug-in named
`OpenCompGraphMaya` in the Plug-in Manager (menu `Windows >
Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager`).
